# Projects- Hardware

Here's a collection of hardware projects I've worked on, combining what I’ve learned in my ECE courses with hands-on building and problem-solving:

1. Third Eye for the Blind (ECE 198 Honors Project)-     
   It is an assistive device designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and provides feedback through vibrations and sound. As the user approaches an object, the vibration intensity and beep frequency both increase to indicate the proximity of the object.

2. Adjustable Sine Wave Generator (ECE 110 Final Project)-
   This project involved designing a circuit that generates a sine wave with adjustable amplitude (10–12 Vpp), frequency (400–800 Hz), and customizable top and bottom clipping. The circuit was built using a 555 timer IC to produce a square wave, followed by four low-pass filters to smooth it into a sine wave. A voltage divider was used to set clipping thresholds, and three operational amplifier ICs controlled the amplitude and applied the clipping, all arranged in sequence.
