# Projects-hardware

Here's a collection of hardware projects I've worked on, combining what Iâ€™ve learned in my ECE courses with hands-on building and problem-solving:

1. Third Eye for the Blind (ECE 198 Honors Project)-     
   It is an assistive device designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and provides feedback through vibrations and sound. As the user approaches an object, the vibration intensity and beep frequency both increase to signal proximity.
